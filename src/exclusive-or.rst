Exclusive or
------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Exclusive also known as “XOR” is a Boolean [#boolean]_ binary [#binary]_ operator.
XOR is true when either the first input or the second input, but not
both, are true.

XOR can be thought of as a “programmable
inverter.” One input bit decides whether to invert another input bit,
or to pass it through unchanged. “Inverting” bits is colloquially
called “flipping” bits. Flipping bits is a term we use often throughout the book.

In mathematics and cryptography papers, exclusive or XOR is 
represented by a cross in a circle: :math:`\xor`. We use the same
notation in this book:

The inputs and outputs are named as if XOR is an
encryption operation. On the left, we have the plaintext bit
:math:`P_i`. The :math:`i` is an index, since we will usually deal
with more than one such bit. On top, we have the key bit :math:`k_i`,
that decides whether or not to invert :math:`P_i`. On the right, we have
the ciphertext bit, :math:`C_i`, which is the result of the XOR
operation.

.. [#boolean]
   Uses only “true” and “false” as input and output values.

.. [#binary]
   Takes two parameters.

A few properties of XOR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lets take a closer look at the properties of XOR since
we deal with it extensively in this book. Feel free to skip this section
if you are already familiar with XOR.

We saw that the output of XOR is 1 when one input or the other (but not
both) is 1:

.. math::

   \begin{array}{c@{\hspace{2em}}c}
   0 \xor 0 = 0 & 1 \xor 0 = 1 \\
   0 \xor 1 = 1 & 1 \xor 1 = 0
   \end{array}

A few useful arithmetic tricks can be derived from this.

#. XOR can be applied in any order:
   :math:`a \xor (b \xor c) = (a \xor b) \xor c`
#. The operands can be flipped around: :math:`a \xor b = b \xor a`
#. Any bit XOR itself is 0: :math:`a \xor a = 0`. If :math:`a` is 0,
   then :math:`0 \xor 0 = 0`; if :math:`a` is 1, then :math:`1 \xor 1 = 0`.
#. Any bit XOR 0 is that bit again: :math:`a \xor 0 = a`. If :math:`a`
   is 0, then :math:`0 \xor 0 = 0`; if :math:`a` is 1, then
   :math:`1 \xor 0 = 1`.

These rules imply that :math:`a \xor b \xor a = b`:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   a \xor b \xor a & = a \xor a \xor b & \; & \text{(second rule)} \\
                   & = 0 \xor b        & \; & \text{(third rule)} \\
                   & = b               & \; & \text{(fourth rule)}
   \end{aligned}

We use this property for XOR encryption. The first XOR :math:`a` can be thought of 
as encrypting, and the second one as decrypting.

Bitwise XOR
~~~~~~~~~~~

XOR, as we've just defined it, operates only on single bits or Boolean
values. Since we usually deal with values comprised of many bits, most
programming languages provide a “bitwise XOR” operator: an operator that
performs XOR on the respective bits in a value.

As an example, Python has the ``^`` (caret) operator performing
bitwise XOR on integers. It first expresses two
integers in binary [#binary-integer]_, and then performs XOR on their respective
bits. Hence the name, *bitwise* XOR.

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   73 \xor 87 & = 0b1001001 \xor 0b1010111 \\
              & = \begin{array}{*{7}{C{\widthof{$\xor$}}}c}
                      1    & 0    & 0    & 1    & 0    & 0    & 1    & \quad \text{(left)}\\
                      \xor & \xor & \xor & \xor & \xor & \xor & \xor & \\
                      1    & 0    & 1    & 0    & 1    & 1    & 1    & \quad \text{(right)}\\
                  \end{array} \\
              & = \begin{array}{*{7}{C{\widthof{$\xor$}}}}
                      0    & 0    & 1    & 1    & 1    & 1    & 0
                  \end{array} \\
              & = 0b0011110 \\
              & = 30 \\
   \end{aligned}

.. [#binary-integer]
   Usually, numbers are internally stored in binary, so this
   does not take any work. When a number is prefixed with
   “0b” it means that the remaining digits are a binary representation.

One-time pads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

XOR may seem like an awfully simple, even trivial operator. Even so,
there is an encryption scheme. It is called a one-time pad, which consists of
a single operator with a sequence (“pad”) of random bits. The security of the
scheme depends on using the pad only once. The sequence is called a pad
because it was originally recorded on a physical, paper pad.

The scheme is unique not only in its simplicity. It
has the highest security guarantee possible. If the bits are truly
random, they become unpredictable for an attacker. Additionally, if the pad is only
used once, the attacker learns nothing about the plaintext when viewing
a ciphertext. [#msg-exists]_

.. [#msg-exists]
   The attacker does learn that the message exists and the message length
   in this simple scheme. While this typically is not too
   important, there are situations where this matters. 
   Secure cryptosystems exist to both hide the existence and the length of
   a message.


Suppose we can translate our plaintext into a sequence of bits. We also
have the pad of random bits, shared between the sender and the (one or
more) recipients. We can compute the ciphertext by taking the bitwise
XOR of the two sequences of bits.

.. figure:: Illustrations/XOR/OTP.svg
   :align: center
   :alt: OTP

If an attacker sees the ciphertext, we can prove that
zero information is learned about the plaintext without the key. This property is
called *perfect secrecy*. The proof can be understood intuitively. 
Think of XOR as a programmable inverter, and look at a
particular bit intercepted by Eve, the eavesdropper.

.. figure:: Illustrations/XOR/OTPEve.svg
   :align: center
   :alt: OTP eve

Let's say Eve sees that a particular ciphertext bit :math:`c_i` is 1.
She has no idea if the matching plaintext bit :math:`p_i` was 0 or 1,
because she has no idea if the key bit :math:`k_i` was 0 or 1. Since all
of the key bits are truly random, both options are exactly equally
probable.

Attacks on “one-time pads”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The one-time pad security guarantee only holds if used correctly.
First of all, the one-time pad must consist of truly random data.
Secondly, the one-time pad can only be used once (hence the name).
Unfortunately, most commercial products that claim to be “one-time pads”
are snake oil [#snake-oil]_, and do not satisfy at least one of these two
properties.

.. [#snake-oil]
   “Snake oil” is a term for dubious products that claim
   extraordinary benefits and features, yet do not realize any of
   them.

Not using truly random data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first issue is that various deterministic constructs 
produce the one-time pad instead of using truly random data. That is not
necessarily insecure: in fact, the most obvious example, a synchronous
stream cipher, is something we will see later in the book. However, it
does invalidate the “unbreakable” security property of one-time pads.
The end user is better served by a more honest cryptosystem,
not one that lies about its security properties.

Reusing the “one-time” pad
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The other issue is with key reuse, which is much more serious. Suppose
an attacker gets two ciphertexts with the same “one-time” pad. The
attacker can then XOR the two ciphertexts, which is also the XOR of the
plaintexts:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   c_1 \xor c_2
   &= (p_1 \xor k) \xor (p_2 \xor k) && (\text{definition})\\
   &= p_1 \xor k \xor p_2 \xor k && (\text{reorder terms})\\
   &= p_1 \xor p_2 \xor k \xor k && (a \xor b = b \xor a) \\
   &= p_1 \xor p_2 \xor 0 && (x \xor x = 0) \\
   &= p_1 \xor p_2 && (x \xor 0 = x)
   \end{aligned}

At first sight, that may not seem like an issue. To extract either
:math:`p_1` or :math:`p_2`, you'd need to cancel out the XOR operation,
which means you need to know the other plaintext. The problem is that
even the result of the XOR operation on two plaintexts contains quite a
bit of information about the plaintexts themselves. We'll illustrate this
visually with some images from a broken “one-time” pad process, starting
with :numref:`fig-multitimepad`.

   Two plaintexts, the re-used key, their respective
   ciphertexts, and the XOR of the ciphertexts. Plaintext information clearly
   leaks through when we XOR the ciphertexts.

Crib-dragging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A classic approach to break multi-time pad systems is
“crib-dragging.” Crib-dragging uses small sequences expected
to occur with high probability. Those sequences are “cribs”. The
name crib-dragging originates from the fact that these small “cribs” are
dragged from left to right across each ciphertext, and from top to
bottom across the ciphertexts, in the hope of finding a match.
The matches form the sites of the start, or “crib”, if you will, of
further decryption.

The idea is fairly simple. Suppose we have several encrypted messages
:math:`C_i` encrypted with the same “one-time” pad :math:`K`
[#capital-letters]_. If we could correctly guess the plaintext for one of the
messages, let's say :math:`C_j`, we'd know :math:`K`:

.. [#capital-letters]
   We use capital letters when referring to an entire message, as
   opposed to just bits of a message.


.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   C_j \xor P_j
   &= (P_j \xor K) \xor P_j \\
   &= K \xor P_j \xor P_j \\
   &= K \xor 0 \\
   &= K
   \end{aligned}

Since :math:`K` is the shared secret, we can use it to decrypt all
other messages as if we are the recipient:

.. math::

   P_i = C_i \xor K \qquad \text{for all }i

This typically does not work because we cannot
guess an entire message. However, we can guess parts of a message.

If we guess a few plaintext bits :math:`p_i` correctly for *any* of the
messages, that reveals the key bits at that position for *all* of
the messages, since :math:`k = c_i \xor p_i`. Hence, all of the
plaintext bits at that position are revealed. Using that value for
:math:`k`, we can compute the plaintext bits :math:`p_i = c_i \xor k`
for all the other messages.

Guessing parts of the plaintext is easier than guessing the entire
plaintext. Suppose we know that the plaintext is in English. There are
sequences that will occur very commonly. For example (the
:math:`\verb*| |` symbol denotes a space):

-  :math:`\verb*| the |` and variants such as :math:`\verb*|. The |`
-  :math:`\verb*| of |` and variants
-  :math:`\verb*| to |` and variants
-  :math:`\verb*| and |` (no variants; only occurs in the middle of a sentence)
-  :math:`\verb*| a |` and variants

We can make better guesses if more information is known about the plaintext.
For example, if HTML is served over HTTP, we expect to see
``Content-Type``, ``<a>``, and so on.

This only tells us which plaintext sequences are likely, giving us
likely guesses. How can we tell if the guesses are correct? If
our guess is correct, we know all the plaintexts at that position
based on using the technique described earlier. We can simply look at
those plaintexts and decide if they look correct.

In practice, the process needs to be automated because of all potential 
guesses. Fortunately that is easy to do. For example,
a simple but effective method is to count how often different
symbols occur in the guessed plaintexts: if the messages contain English
text, we expect to see a lot of letters e, t, a, o, i, n. If we
see binary nonsense instead, we know that the guess was probably
incorrect, or perhaps that message is actually binary data.

These small, highly probable sequences are known as “cribs” because
they are the start of a larger decryption process. Suppose your crib,
``the``, was successful and found the five-letter sequence ``t thr`` in
another message. You can use a dictionary to find common words
starting with ``thr``, such as ``through``. If that is a correct guess,
it can reveal four more bytes in all of the ciphertexts. This information can be
useful for revealing more. Similarly, you can use the dictionary to find
words ending in ``t``.

This becomes greatly effective for plaintexts that we know more
about. If HTTP data has the plaintext ``ent-Len``, then we
can expand that to ``Content-Length:``. More bytes are easily revealed.

While this technique works as soon as two messages are encrypted with
the same key, it is clear that the process becomes simpler when more
ciphertexts use the same key. Since all of the steps become more
effective, we get:

-  More cribbing positions.
-  More plaintext bytes revealed with each successful crib and
   guess. This leads to more guessing options elsewhere.
-  More ciphertexts available for any given position. This simplifies guess
   validation and at times increases accuracy.

We have reviewed simple ideas for breaking multi-time pads. While they are
already quite effective, people invent more effective
methods by applying advanced, statistical models using natural
language analysis. This further demonstrates just how broken
multi-time pads are. :cite:`mason:nltwotimepads`

Remaining problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Real one-time pads, implemented properly, have an extremely strong
security guarantee. It would appear, then, that cryptography is over:
encryption is a solved problem, and we can all go home. Obviously,
that is not the case.

One-time pads are rarely used for being horribly impractical.
The key is at least as large as all information you would like transmitted,
*put together*. Plus, the keys must be exchanged securely, ahead
of time, with all people you would like to communicate with. We would like to
communicate securely with everyone on the Internet, and that is a very
large number of people. Furthermore, since the keys must consist of
truly random data for the security property to hold, key generation is
difficult and time-consuming without specialized hardware.

One-time pads pose a trade-off. An advantage is that a one-time pad is an algorithm with a solid
information-theoretic security guarantee. The guarantee is not available with any
other system. On the other hand, the key exchange requirements are exteremely impractical. 
However, throughout this book,
we will see that secure symmetric encryption algorithms are not the pain point of modern
cryptosystems. Cryptographers have designed many such algorithms.
Practical key management, on the other hand, is one of the toughest challenges facing
modern cryptography. One-time pads may solve a problem, but it is the
wrong problem.

One-time pads may have practical use, but they are obviously not a panacea. We need
a system with both manageable key sizes and the capability of maintaining secrecy at the same time.
Additionally, a system to negotiate keys over the Internet with complete strangers is necessary.
