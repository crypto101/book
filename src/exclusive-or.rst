Exclusive or
------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Exclusive or, often called “XOR”, is a Boolean [#boolean]_ binary [#binary]_ operator
that is true when either the first input or the second input, but not
both, are true.

Another way to think of XOR is as something called a “programmable
inverter”: one input bit decides whether to invert the other input bit,
or to just pass it through unchanged. “Inverting” bits is colloquially
called “flipping” bits, a term we'll use often throughout the book.

In mathematics and cryptography papers, exclusive or is generally
represented by a cross in a circle: :math:`\xor`. We'll use the same
notation in this book:

The inputs and output here are named as if we're using XOR as an
encryption operation. On the left, we have the plaintext bit
:math:`P_i`. The :math:`i` is just an index, since we'll usually deal
with more than one such bit. On top, we have the key bit :math:`k_i`,
that decides whether or not to invert :math:`P_i`. On the right, we have
the ciphertext bit, :math:`C_i`, which is the result of the XOR
operation.

.. [#boolean]
   Uses only “true” and “false” as input and output values.

.. [#binary]
   Takes two parameters.

A few properties of XOR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since we'll be dealing with XOR extensively during this book, we'll take
a closer look at some of its properties. If you're already familiar with
how XOR works, feel free to skip this section.

We saw that the output of XOR is 1 when one input or the other (but not
both) is 1:

.. math::

   \begin{array}{c@{\hspace{2em}}c}
   0 \xor 0 = 0 & 1 \xor 0 = 1 \\
   0 \xor 1 = 1 & 1 \xor 1 = 0
   \end{array}

There are a few useful arithmetic tricks we can derive from that.

#. You can apply XOR in any order:
   :math:`a \xor (b \xor c) = (a \xor b) \xor c`
#. You can flip the operands around: :math:`a \xor b = b \xor a`
#. Any bit XOR itself is 0: :math:`a \xor a = 0`. If :math:`a` is 0,
   then it's :math:`0 \xor 0 = 0`; if :math:`a` is 1, then it's :math:`1 \xor 1 = 0`.
#. Any bit XOR 0 is that bit again: :math:`a \xor 0 = a`. If :math:`a`
   is 0, then it's :math:`0 \xor 0 = 0`; if :math:`a` is 1, then it's
   :math:`1 \xor 0 = 1`.

These rules also imply :math:`a \xor b \xor a = b`:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   a \xor b \xor a & = a \xor a \xor b & \; & \text{(second rule)} \\
                   & = 0 \xor b        & \; & \text{(third rule)} \\
                   & = b               & \; & \text{(fourth rule)}
   \end{aligned}

We'll use this property often when using XOR for encryption; you can
think of that first XOR with :math:`a` as encrypting, and the second one
as decrypting.

Bitwise XOR
~~~~~~~~~~~

XOR, as we've just defined it, operates only on single bits or Boolean
values. Since we usually deal with values comprised of many bits, most
programming languages provide a “bitwise XOR” operator: an operator that
performs XOR on the respective bits in a value.

Python, for example, provides the ``^`` (caret) operator that performs
bitwise XOR on integers. It does this by first expressing those two
integers in binary [#binary-integer]_, and then performing XOR on their respective
bits. Hence the name, *bitwise* XOR.

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   73 \xor 87 & = 0b1001001 \xor 0b1010111 \\
              & = \begin{array}{*{7}{C{\widthof{$\xor$}}}c}
                      1    & 0    & 0    & 1    & 0    & 0    & 1    & \quad \text{(left)}\\
                      \xor & \xor & \xor & \xor & \xor & \xor & \xor & \\
                      1    & 0    & 1    & 0    & 1    & 1    & 1    & \quad \text{(right)}\\
                  \end{array} \\
              & = \begin{array}{*{7}{C{\widthof{$\xor$}}}}
                      0    & 0    & 1    & 1    & 1    & 1    & 0
                  \end{array} \\
              & = 0b0011110 \\
              & = 30 \\
   \end{aligned}

.. [#binary-integer]
   Usually, numbers are already stored in binary internally, so this
   doesn't actually take any work. When you see a number prefixed with
   “0b”, the remaining digits are a binary representation.

One-time pads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

XOR may seem like an awfully simple, even trivial operator. Even so,
there's an encryption scheme, called a one-time pad, which consists of
just that single operator. It's called a one-time pad because it
involves a sequence (the “pad”) of random bits, and the security of the
scheme depends on only using that pad once. The sequence is called a pad
because it was originally recorded on a physical, paper pad.

This scheme is unique not only in its simplicity, but also because it
has the strongest possible security guarantee. If the bits are truly
random (and therefore unpredictable by an attacker), and the pad is only
used once, the attacker learns nothing about the plaintext when they see
a ciphertext. [#msg-exists]_

.. [#msg-exists]
   The attacker does learn that the message exists, and, in this simple
   scheme, the length of the message. While this typically isn't too
   important, there are situations where this might matter, and there
   are secure cryptosystems to both hide the existence and the length of
   a message.


Suppose we can translate our plaintext into a sequence of bits. We also
have the pad of random bits, shared between the sender and the (one or
more) recipients. We can compute the ciphertext by taking the bitwise
XOR of the two sequences of bits.

.. figure:: Illustrations/XOR/OTP.svg
   :align: center
   :alt: OTP

If an attacker sees the ciphertext, we can prove that they will learn
zero information about the plaintext without the key. This property is
called *perfect security*. The proof can be understood intuitively by
thinking of XOR as a programmable inverter, and then looking at a
particular bit intercepted by Eve, the eavesdropper.

.. figure:: Illustrations/XOR/OTPEve.svg
   :align: center
   :alt: OTP eve

Let's say Eve sees that a particular ciphertext bit :math:`c_i` is 1.
She has no idea if the matching plaintext bit :math:`p_i` was 0 or 1,
because she has no idea if the key bit :math:`k_i` was 0 or 1. Since all
of the key bits are truly random, both options are exactly equally
probable.

Attacks on “one-time pads”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The one-time pad security guarantee only holds if it is used correctly.
First of all, the one-time pad has to consist of truly random data.
Secondly, the one-time pad can only be used once (hence the name).
Unfortunately, most commercial products that claim to be “one-time pads”
are snake oil [#snake-oil]_, and don't satisfy at least one of those two
properties.

.. [#snake-oil]
   “Snake oil” is a term for all sorts of dubious products that claim
   extraordinary benefits and features, but don't really realize any of
   them.

Not using truly random data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first issue is that they use various deterministic constructs to
produce the one-time pad, instead of using truly random data. That isn't
necessarily insecure: in fact, the most obvious example, a synchronous
stream cipher, is something we'll see later in the book. However, it
does invalidate the “unbreakable” security property of one-time pads.
The end user would be better served by a more honest cryptosystem,
instead of one that lies about its security properties.

Reusing the “one-time” pad
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The other issue is with key reuse, which is much more serious. Suppose
an attacker gets two ciphertexts with the same “one-time” pad. The
attacker can then XOR the two ciphertexts, which is also the XOR of the
plaintexts:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   c_1 \xor c_2
   &= (p_1 \xor k) \xor (p_2 \xor k) && (\text{definition})\\
   &= p_1 \xor k \xor p_2 \xor k && (\text{reorder terms})\\
   &= p_1 \xor p_2 \xor k \xor k && (a \xor b = b \xor a) \\
   &= p_1 \xor p_2 \xor 0 && (x \xor x = 0) \\
   &= p_1 \xor p_2 && (x \xor 0 = x)
   \end{aligned}

At first sight, that may not seem like an issue. To extract either
:math:`p_1` or :math:`p_2`, you'd need to cancel out the XOR operation,
which means you need to know the other plaintext. The problem is that
even the result of the XOR operation on two plaintexts contains quite a
bit information about the plaintexts themselves. We'll illustrate this
visually with some images from a broken “one-time” pad process, starting
with :numref:`fig-multitimepad`.

   Two plaintexts, the re-used key, their respective
   ciphertexts, and the XOR of the ciphertexts. Information about the
   plaintexts clearly leaks through when we XOR the ciphertexts.

Crib-dragging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A classical approach to breaking multi-time pad systems involves
“crib-dragging”, a process that uses small sequences that are expected
to occur with high probability. Those sequences are called “cribs”. The
name crib-dragging originated from the fact that these small “cribs” are
dragged from left to right across each ciphertext, and from top to
bottom across the ciphertexts, in the hope of finding a match somewhere.
Those matches form the sites of the start, or “crib”, if you will, of
further decryption.

The idea is fairly simple. Suppose we have several encrypted messages
:math:`C_i` encrypted with the same “one-time” pad :math:`K`
[#capital-letters]_. If we could correctly guess the plaintext for one of the
messages, let's say :math:`C_j`, we'd know :math:`K`:

.. [#capital-letters]
   We use capital letters when referring to an entire message, as
   opposed to just bits of a message.


.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   C_j \xor P_j
   &= (P_j \xor K) \xor P_j \\
   &= K \xor P_j \xor P_j \\
   &= K \xor 0 \\
   &= K
   \end{aligned}

Since :math:`K` is the shared secret, we can now use it to decrypt all
of the other messages, just as if we were the recipient:

.. math::

   P_i = C_i \xor K \qquad \text{for all }i

Since we usually can't guess an entire message, this doesn't actually
work. However, we might be able to guess parts of a message.

If we guess a few plaintext bits :math:`p_i` correctly for *any* of the
messages, that would reveal the key bits at that position for *all* of
the messages, since :math:`k = c_i \xor p_i`. Hence, all of the
plaintext bits at that position are revealed: using that value for
:math:`k`, we can compute the plaintext bits :math:`p_i = c_i \xor k`
for all the other messages.

Guessing parts of the plaintext is a lot easier than guessing the entire
plaintext. Suppose we know that the plaintext is in English. There are
some sequences that we know will occur very commonly, for example (the
:math:`\verb*| |` symbol denotes a space):

-  :math:`\verb*| the |` and variants such as :math:`\verb*|. The |`
-  :math:`\verb*| of |` and variants
-  :math:`\verb*| to |` and variants
-  :math:`\verb*| and |` (no variants; only occurs in the middle of a sentence)
-  :math:`\verb*| a |` and variants

We can make better guesses if more information is known about the plaintext.
For example, if HTTP is serving HTML we expect to see
`Content-Type``, ``<a>``, and so on.

This only tells us which plaintext sequences are likely, giving us
likely guesses. How can we tell if the guesses are correct? If
our guess is correct, we know all the plaintexts at that position
based on using the technique described earlier. We can simply look at
those plaintexts and decide if they look correct.

In practice, the process needs to be automated because of all potential 
guesses. Fortunately that is easy to do. For example,
a simple but effective method is to count how often different
symbols occur in the guessed plaintexts: if the messages contain English
text, we expect to see a lot of letters e, t, a, o, i, n. If we
see binary nonsense instead, we know that the guess was probably
incorrect, or perhaps that message is actually binary data.

These small, highly probable sequences are known as “cribs” because
they are the start of a larger decryption process. Suppose your crib,
``the``, was successful and found the five-letter sequence ``t thr`` in
another message. You can use a dictionary to find common words
starting with ``thr``, such as ``through``. If that is a correct guess,
it can reveal four more bytes in all of the ciphertexts. This information can be
useful for revealing more. Similarly, you can use the dictionary to find
words ending in ``t``.

This becomes greatly effective for plaintexts that we know more
about. If HTTP data has the plaintext ``ent-Len``, then we
can expand that to ``Content-Length:``. More bytes are easily revealed.

While this technique works as soon as two messages are encrypted with
the same key, it is clear that the process becomes simpler when more
ciphertexts use the same key. Since all of the steps become more
effective we get:

-  More cribbing positions.
-  More plaintext bytes revealed with each successful crib and
   guess. This leads to more guessing options elsewhere.
-  More ciphertexts available for any given position. This simplies guess
   validation and at times increases accuracy.

We have reviewed simple ideas for breaking multi-time pads. While they are
already quite effective, people invent more effective
methods by applying advanced, statistical models using natural
language analysis. This further demonstrates just how broken
multi-time pads are. :cite:`mason:nltwotimepads`

Remaining problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Real one-time pads, implemented properly, have an extremely strong
security guarantee. It would appear, then, that cryptography is over:
encryption is a solved problem, and we can all go home. Obviously,
that is not the case.

One-time pads are rarely used for being horribly impractical.
The key is at least as large as all information you would like transmitted,
*put together*. Plus, the keys must be exchanged securely, ahead
of time, with all people in your communication network. We like to
communicate securely with everyone on the Internet, and that is a very
large number of people. Furthermore, since the keys must consist of
truly random data for the security property to hold, key generation is
difficult and time-consuming without specialized hardware.

One-time pads pose a trade-off. An advantage is that a one-time pad is an algorithm with a solid
information-theoretic security guarantee. The guarantee is not available with any
other system. On the other hand, the key exchange requirements are exteremely impractical. 
However, throughout this book,
we will see that secure symmetric encryption algorithms are not the pain point of modern
cryptosystems. Cryptographers designed plenty while
practical key management is the toughest challenges facing
modern cryptography. One-time pads may solve a problem, but it is the
wrong problem.

One-time pads may have practical use, but they are obviously not a panacea. We need
a system with manageable key sizes and capable of maintaining secrecy. Additionally, a 
system to negotiate keys over the Internet with complete strangers is necessary.
